# chacana-law-e

Minimal geometric abstraction inspired by the Andean Chakana (Inca cross).

This repository explores a bounded orthogonal structure with a central void,
expressed as a purely geometric and continuous form.

No optimization, learning signal, objective, or control mechanism is implemented.
The model exposes structure without function, symmetry without regulation.

This work is shared as an open research primitive by Neomundi Labs.

## Scope

- Geometry only
- Orthogonality and bounded symmetry
- Central void as structural invariant
- No AI, no agent, no optimization
- No applied or operational use-case

This repository is not a control or governance system.
